        <h2>Are you interested in my self?</h2>


    
        <p>I am a human being. A real life living one of flesh and 
        everything. I have skin all over my body in the right 
        places and none in the wrong places. I like other creatures, 
        especially water based ones, Amphibians are even better than
        fish because you can take them out of the water too. But you
        shouldn't stroke them because you have dirty oily hands and
        you will upset their smooth little bodies.</p>
